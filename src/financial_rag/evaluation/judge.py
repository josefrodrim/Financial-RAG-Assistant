_JUDGE_PROMPT = """\
Evaluate if the answer is faithful to the source context blocks below.

Question: {question}

Source context blocks:
{contexts}

Answer given:
{answer}

Rate the faithfulness on this scale:
0 = Answer contradicts sources or invents information not in the context blocks
1 = Answer is partially grounded but contains unsupported claims or inferences
2 = Answer is mostly grounded with minor unsupported additions
3 = Answer is fully grounded — every claim traces back to the context blocks,
    or correctly states that information is not available

Rules:
- Compare each claim in the answer against the context blocks literally.
- General background or inferences not in the blocks count as unsupported (max score 2).
- If contexts are empty and the answer says "no information found", rate 3.
- If contexts are empty but the answer makes specific claims, rate 0.
- Respond with ONLY a single digit: 0, 1, 2, or 3. Nothing else.\
